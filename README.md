Take back control of your touhpad!

Most non-macintosh laptops use a Synaptics TouchPad, frequently with various tweaks
by the manufacturer. The drivers for this allow a small range of customisation,
mainly just enabling/disabling various features, but you are unable to customise
what those features actually do.

However, the driver is capable of a lot more, which can be achieved through some
fiddling with it's registry keys. This application provides a (hopefully) simple
interface through which you can modify the actionsand gestures for your touchpad.

Yes, I am aware that there is an Synaptics API I could use, but that would require
more or less coding all the gestures, etc, and would require the application to constantly run in the background. Though I'll definately take a look into it later,
this should do the job just fine in the meantime.
